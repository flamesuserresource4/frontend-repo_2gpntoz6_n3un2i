            Liquidity backstops have become a strategic asset. Bilateral swap lines, once niche, now sit
            alongside defense treaties in alliance toolkits. The question is less whether they exist and
            more how conditional they are, and who writes the conditions.
          </p>

            Sanctions architecture, increasingly modular, is exporting compliance regimes across entire
            industries. That diffusion, in turn, shapes corporate strategy—particularly in shipping, insurance,
            and commodity trading.
          </p>
          <h3>Why this matters</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Swap lines and liquidity support can stabilize allies faster than formal bailouts.</li>
            <li>Sanctions policy drives routing decisions across maritime chokepoints.</li>
            <li>Programmable documentation is the next frontier for trade compliance.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            "The financial plumbing of alliances is now as consequential as their military hardware."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The next frontier is programmability: expect pilot corridors where trade documentation and
            sanctions screening are cryptographically verifiable at port.
