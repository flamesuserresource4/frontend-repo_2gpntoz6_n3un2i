      'A tentative ceasefire has reconfigured risk premiums across the energy complex, as tankers resume traffic along a newly secured corridor. Traders priced in a narrower Brent-Dubai spread while shippers tested alternative insurance riders drafted over the weekend.',
      'Regional capitals are recalibrating their security guarantees, with transit states leveraging new customs protocols to extract development concessions. Meanwhile, defense ministries are prioritizing unmanned ISR to monitor chokepoints without escalating naval presence.',
      'For markets, the near-term story is about logistics flexibility. If corridor uptime exceeds 80% over the next 30 days, refiners are likely to revert to pre-crisis slates, easing crack spreads. But political risk remains embedded: a single incident could redraw the route map again.',

      'A surprise coalition in a key Indo-Pacific democracy is already reshaping committee assignments that govern export controls. Expect continuity on maritime domain awareness, but a sharper industrial policy tilt for upstream chip tools and critical minerals.',

      'Liquidity backstops have become a strategic asset. Bilateral swap lines, once niche, now sit alongside defense treaties in alliance toolkits. The question is less whether they exist and more how conditional they are, and who writes the conditions.',
      'Sanctions architecture, increasingly modular, is exporting compliance regimes across entire industries. That diffusion, in turn, shapes corporate strategy—particularly in shipping, insurance, and commodity trading.',
